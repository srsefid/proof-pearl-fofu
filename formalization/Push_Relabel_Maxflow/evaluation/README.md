Benchmarks

To reproduce the benchmarks, type
./bench_make.sh     # This will create the data, and compile the programs
./bench_exec.sh     # This will run the benchmarks. Do not to load your machine with other jobs while benchmarking, to get precise results.
./bench_print.sh    # To get a pretty-print of the data
./bench_clean.sh    # To clean-up old logs from all folders
